IQVIA,
Durham, NC

Dear Hiring Professional,

I am writing to apply for the summer internship program at IQVIA. I discovered your organization through the career center at my university and, after reading up on the work your company does, believe that my experiences as a research assistant at Columbia University and Vanderbilt University and my education in biostatistics at Columbia will make me an asset to your department. 

The experiences I had as a research assistant in both biomedical and diabetes departments, coupled with my coursework in math and biology, have shown me that a career in biostatistics would fit me well. My career objective is to work as a biostatistician in order to develop better treatment options for individual cases based on statistical information. I took SAS course with residents at Columbia in 2018 summer. I learned to apply numerical, tabular, and graphical descriptive techniques to summarize data, apply appropriate statistical methods in given research settings. In my role as a research assistant in the biomedical informatics department at Columbia this past year, I designed innovative web applications that facilitated predicting pathogenicity of variants and analyzed 3D coding structural coverage of human proteins and matched with cancer related variants by R. The goal of this project was to compare cancer related variantsâ€™ distribution between positive pathogenic and control samples, which can be used as a feature in other genetic model. In 2019 spring, I am going to take more courses related to data management and coordination using structured, computer-based exercises, including clinical trials, pharmaceutical statistics and SQL. I believe that my experiences in both research and data analysis will benefit your department while at the same time help me learn about biostatistics intern from IQVIA in the industry. 

Communication is an important factor when working in this industry. Since I worked as a tutor before, I have the ability to convey technical and other information proficiently. My active listening and good interpersonal skills also help me stand out.
I look forward to the opportunity of further discussing the role, and both the professional and social skills I can offer to the summer internship program. Please feel free to reach out with any questions, or if you would like to view particular project samples. Thank you very much for your time and consideration for the position. 

Sincerely,

Jingwei Ren
